Chapter 6.	2D Capsule Networks Detect Perceived Changes in Infant~Environment Relationship Reflected in 3D Infant Movement Dynamics

We expand the application of CapsNet to include the analysis of infant intrinsic movement. We assessed images and Motion Capture (MoCap) data from multiple infants to determine if AI can be used to investigate infant intrinsic movement and the detection of baby-mobile interactions at various stages awareness.
